        <div class="blurb-box">  
                <p> Justin is a Brisbane based full stack web developer with a passion for creating engaging and imaginative systems. He grew up on a small potato farm in regional NSW where he learned the value of hard work and perseverance. At the age of 17 he left home to move to Sydney where he spent his weekdays as a factory worker and his weekends enjoying live theatre and dance parties. Over time his love of live events became his work and he worked as a Live Audio Engineer for theatre and events. During COVID lockdown whilst venues across the globe closed down Justin took the opportunity to explore new fields of interest. It was at this time he fell in love with web development, coding and VR. He realised the unbridled opportunity to create tools to help people bring their dreams to life. Justin now endeavours daily to continue expanding his skills and is passionate and focused on bringing all that he has learnt to all those he works with. </p>
